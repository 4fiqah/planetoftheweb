Hi there, this is Ray Villalobos welcome to this course.

We're going to create an interface using jQuery using HTML code that uses the Bootstrap 4 framework.

I'll start by showing you how to work with jQuery's powerful selector engine to choose elements in your DOM and then manage actions using jQuery events.

I'll show you how to work with data by loading external data using jQuery's AJAX methods. We'll learn how you can use plugins to extend the functionality of jQuery using a templating engine to make it easier to build your pages and adding a date plugin to make formatting dates simple.

I'll show you how to use the powerful underscore library to manage your data in your application and make it extremely easy to take care of sorting, searching through and managing your information.

Finally, We'll finish up the application by showing you how to add as well as edit data.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
