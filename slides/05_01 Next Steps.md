# Introduction
Thanks for watching this course. jQuery is an extremely popular network, but it tends to get a bad rap. I built this course partly because I wanted to show how fun and easy it is to use. If you're curious about how it stacks up against the competition, this course is part of a series of courses where I build the same application using different frameworks.

For example, you can check out Building an Interface with React or Building an interface with Vue.js.

I plan to do more of these courses with perhaps a building an interface with AngularJS in the future so if you want to check out what I'm up to, you can check out all of my courses at this URL.
