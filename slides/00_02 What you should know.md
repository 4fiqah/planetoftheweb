This is not a beginner course and I'm assuming that you've got some experience before coming to this course.

You should have experience creating websites and specifically have some type of background with HTML, CSS and a good understanding of JavaScript.

This course also uses a template that uses the bootstrap framework, but it focuses just on using jQuery, so if you want to learn more about creating sites and forms with Bootstrap, check out Bootstrap Essential Training.

Because we're using AJAX to read information from a file, you need to run some of this code using a server as opposed to just dragging the index.html file onto a browser. I've set up some automation for you, so it would be nice if you understand how to work with a build process.

All of the code for this course is hosted on Github. You can easily download the code to your machine from jQuery, but it would be nice to have some familiarity with Git and Github. A great course to watch for that is Learning Git and Github.

If you're comfortable with these requirements...let's get started.
